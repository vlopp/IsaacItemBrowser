Once one item is picked up the other will disappear. \n  In the Boss Rush Room, where all 4 items can be rerolled at once. \n  With There's Options , both boss items can be rerolled.\nItems from golden chests or red chests can be rerolled.\nUnlike in Wrath of the Lamb, items like Cube of Meat and Little C.H.A.D. when dropped from bosses can be re-rolled into other items.\nWhen an item pool is exhausted, every item will be rerolled to Breakfast.\nIf Isaac runs out of red hearts in the Devil Room, then rerolls, the prices of the items switch over to soul hearts.\nUsing the D6 on an active item yields different rerolls depending on whether you picked up the active item first.\nUsing the D6 to reroll items duplicated with Diplopia will reroll all the items into different items. The copied item will not be rerolled into the same one as the original item.\nWith Sharp Plug and any combination of items that can infinitely regenerate health, the D6 can be used to reroll items indefinitely.\nBe careful when rerolling, as it will replace the item with another item from the current room's item pool. For example, rerolling an item after defeating The Fallen will replace the Devil Room item he drops to a random item from the normal boss item pool. This behavior can be an advantage in Angel Rooms, since Key Piece 1 and Key Piece 2 can be rerolled to get a free Angel Room item."

      "effects": "While held, the last door Isaac went through stays open, allowing him to leave the room even if enemies are in it.",
      "notes": "This allows Isaac to leave boss rooms if the fight goes poorly.\n  This becomes particularly useful in The Void , where Isaac can enter a boss room and freely exit. This is useful if the player wants to just reach Delirium , and conversely, can also be used to escape from the Delirium fight if the player needs more time/items to prepare.\nIf a Devil Room has a Krampus fight in it, Isaac may choose not to fight him and leave.\nIf an Angel fight is started in an Angel Room the door will close and prevent leaving despite the Door Stop.\nIf Greed spawns in a Secret Room or Shop, Door Stop can be used to leave and come back to fight Greed again to potentially get multiple Steam Sales.\nHas no effect on Mom's boss room.\nCan be used to reset Holy Mantle shield. Very useful playing as The Lost.\nIf a Locust trinket is equipped as well, can be used to spawn an unlimited amount of locusts by repeatedly entering and exiting a room with enemies in it.\nIf a room contained champion enemies, upon leaving and re-entering the room, all previous champion enemies will have turned to regular enemies."
