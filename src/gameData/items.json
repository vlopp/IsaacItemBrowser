      "Notes": "The black heart is only dropped if the poison was caused by The Virus. The item's effect doesn't extend to poison tears.\n Black flies are the best source of black hearts, since they can't deal any damage, which means that you can poison them without losing health.\n  You can abuse this if you find a Skatole item and a Hive enemy. This will result in an infinite source of black hearts. \n  Although Stonies and Shopkeepers can't be visibly poisoned, they still can drop Black Hearts if destroyed after being touched.\nDue to a glitch or patch, some enemies must be moving to receive poison damage. Some enemies pushing against Isaac that are immobile will not take damage, while the poisoned effect will still show up.\n  Gnawed Leaf and The Virus can still work if Isaac has a short range orbital such as Cube of Meat or Ball of Bandages , as it will kill enemies pushing against Isaac that are not taking poison damage due to immobility while still dropping black hearts.",

The Forgotten will toss bombs after releasing the charge, airborne bombs deal 1.5x his damage if they collide with an enemy with enough speed. Max distance is obtained with minimal charge. If the bomb explodes while charging, a normal ranged bone attack happens after releasing. The melee attack is unaffected.\nGuppy: Dr. Fetus Bombs exploding do not spawn flies.\nKidney Stone: Not recommended. Due to Kidney Stone's massive range decrease, and due to the tear height stat not affecting Dr. Fetus' bombs, they spawn directly in front of Isaac, making self damage very likely.\nLachryphagy: Overridden by Dr. Fetus.\nLead Pencil: Overridden by Dr. Fetus.\nMarked: Overridden by Dr. Fetus.

Both Brimstone and Ipecac shots modify Isaac's damage and tear delay stat, meaning that Ipecac fires slower and Brimstone charges slower, but Brimstone does an extra 40*13 damage. Take care to pre-charge Brimstone so that the Ipecac shot is on cooldown as Isaac enters a room. This interaction also applies to Azazel's mini Brimstone.\nCricket's Body: Main tear splits into four explosive splash tears. The splash tears can still damage Isaac.\nDeath's Touch: Although damage is increased, the tears' hitbox also grows larger which may be detrimental.\nFlat Stone: The Ipecac shots cause full-damage explosions instead of lesser splash damage when they bounce off the floor, though they can also harm Isaac.\nThe Forgotten: The ghost form uses Ipecac as normal. The skeleton form's melee attacks become poisonous and explosive with +4 flat damage; he cannot be hurt by the blasts, but is pushed back by them. The charged boomerang attack is only poisonous.\nGhost Pepper: If a fire is generated at the same time as a Ipecac shot, the Ipecac shot will explode instantly.\nGuppy Transformation: Blue flies are no longer spawned on hit.\n  Ipecac shots now spawn blue flies on hit, both direct and indirect.\nLittle Horn: If an Ipecac shot also happens to have the Little Horn effect, after destroying an enemy it loses its explosive property and effectively is just a normal Little Horn tear.\nLost Contact: Ipecac shots will explode on contact with enemy shots.\nThe Ludovico Technique: Tear damage is increased by 4, explodes when killing an enemy, and comes back to Isaac.\n  +4 damage bonus, no explosion.\nMom's Eye / Loki's Horns: Occasionally shoots backwards or in all 4 directions, with high risk of self-damage.\nThe Parasite: The Ipecac tear will spawn two smaller explosive tears when it collides with a solid object, but not with an enemy. These tears can spawn tears on their own as well, potentially leading to huge chain reactions.\nPiercing tears: Tears will still explode on enemy contact, nullifying piercing.\nRubber Cement: Tears will bounce off walls and rocks and won't explode until they hit the ground. Not recommended, as self damage is likely.\nSoy Milk: Though fire rate is greatly increased, the 20% damage multiplier applies resulting in weak explosions.\nSpectral tears: Ipecac shots no longer explode on contact with obstacles or walls, making accidental self-damage less likely but it's more difficult to open secret doors.\nTech X: The laser ring becomes poisonous and gains +4 damage.\nTechnology: Overridden by Technology.\n  +4 damage bonus, poisonous laser.\nTechnology 2: The +40 damage bonus is not affected by the Technology 2 multiplier making the laser very high powered, but only every other Ipecac shot is actually fired.\nTechnology Zero: High fire rate needed for explosive shots to be connected.\nTiny Planet: Ipecac tears orbit around Isaac for a very long time. They land far enough to not cause self-damage, but that can be relied on only if Isaac is not moving and do not hit enemies.",

For example: the damage caused by walking into a Curse Room adjacent to spawn is not negated. Walking into another room and coming back to spawn resets the Holy Mantle and allows you to safely enter said Curse Room.\nUnlike every other protective effect (like shield or invulnerability), Holy Mantle does not prevent damage from Blood Donation Machines, Devil Beggars, and Blood Rights. This is probably done to avoid exploiting them, given the infinitely rechargeable effect of the Holy Mantle.\nDamage from Sacrifice Room spikes can be blocked by Holy Mantle, but nothing will spawn unless Isaac actually takes damage.\nBad Trip will not damage the player when protected by Holy Mantle.\nThe blocked hit does not count as damage taken for related achievements and will not trigger items that activate upon taking damage, like Dead Bird. This means that such items are still worthless for The Lost.\nIf the player possesses Pyromaniac, the Holy Mantle will appear to be consumed if hit by an explosion before other damage, but will still protect from the first actual hit.\n The Lost starts with this item after donating 879 coins to the Greed Machine.\n Holy Mantle will not recharge after every wave in Greed Mode and will only recharge when the room is left and re-entered.\n Holy Mantle will protect the player from the automatic damage that occurs when the timer runs out in the SPEED! challenge.",

This can greatly increase accuracy but depending on enemies' movements and positions can also damage Isaac.\nThe Parasite: Enemies will be pulled towards both fired tears and split tears. However, because they both travel in opposite directions, the split tears' magnetic effects tend to cancel each other out.\nRubber Cement: Due to tears being reflected back, enemies tend to be pulled towards Isaac with much force.

Players were frustrated, so, with an update, Edmund made it so it would also only drop if the player took no red heart damage against Mom, similar to the conditions for the Devil Room to open its path. Since players would not always receive the Polaroid and might switch it out with another trinket, Edmund wanted to make discovery of The Chest (and its at-the-time new ending) something special.\nAs soon as The Polaroid or The Negative become available, they will drop in place of the regular Boss Room item Mom would otherwise provide, essentially providing a difficulty increase for The Womb and beyond after either has been unlocked.\n  They can, however, be re-rolled (or converted into stat increases with Void ) at the cost of closing off access to Chapter 6."

He was an opposite to his murderous brother Cain, which may explain the mirrored nature of this item. Also, this item was unlocked by defeating The Lamb with Cain, which makes the connection with the Bible more obvious."

      "Notes": "Isaac starts with this item once it is unlocked.\nSince it rerolls every item in the room, it can be convenient to use it in rooms where multiple items are in the same room. For instance:\n  In the Shop, where sometimes multiple items are proposed and can be rerolled. \n  In the Devil Room, when there are multiple deals offered. \n  In the Boss Room after the Mom fight, both The Polaroid and The Negative can be rerolled, at the cost of the opportunity to go to the Chest/Dark Room. Once one item is picked up the other will disappear. \n  In the Boss Rush Room, where all 4 items can be rerolled at once. \n  With There's Options , both boss items can be rerolled.\nItems from golden chests or red chests can be rerolled.\nUnlike in Wrath of the Lamb, items like Cube of Meat and Little C.H.A.D. when dropped from bosses can be re-rolled into other items.\nWhen an item pool is exhausted, every item will be rerolled to Breakfast.\nIf Isaac runs out of red hearts in the Devil Room, then rerolls, the prices of the items switch over to soul hearts.\nUsing the D6 on an active item yields different rerolls depending on whether you picked up the active item first.\nUsing the D6 to reroll items duplicated with Diplopia will reroll all the items into different items. The copied item will not be rerolled into the same one as the original item.\nWith Sharp Plug and any combination of items that can infinitely regenerate health, the D6 can be used to reroll items indefinitely.\nBe careful when rerolling, as it will replace the item with another item from the current room's item pool. For example, rerolling an item after defeating The Fallen will replace the Devil Room item he drops to a random item from the normal boss item pool. This behavior can be an advantage in Angel Rooms, since Key Piece 1 and Key Piece 2 can be rerolled to get a free Angel Room item.",

This also means that players should avoid using this item if they plan on keeping an eternal heart, as activating the item will remove it as well.\n  Like similar items mentioned above, use of this item does not affect Devil or Angel room chances.\nUsing this item as The Lost will result in death.\nWhen picked up, Isaac's tears turn red, though this change is purely cosmetic.\nUsing this item in the Greed Mode Ultra Greed boss room will result in Isaac losing 2-4 coins and dropping 1-3 pennies on the floor similar to being hit by any of the greed enemies.",

Additionally, two Boss Rushes can be entered as long as the total playtime of the run stays under 20 minutes.\nWarning: If used on The Chest or Dark Room when the Door to Mega Satan has been opened, the Golden key will not re-open the door and you will be unable to fight him.\nIf used on an XL floor, the merged chapter can be re-generated as two separate floors instead.\nChallenge and Boss Challenge Rooms will have the same rewards and enemy waves as the Challenge Room in the previous iteration of the floor.",

      "Effect": "Upon activation, Isaac will raise the candle above his head. On pressing a fire button, a red flame, similar to a fireplace, will fire in the chosen direction that deals a maximum of 125 damage per flame.\n  The flame also destroys enemy shots it comes into contact with, which decreases its size each time being hit until the flame is entirely extinguished by this process.\nThe flame projectile is persistent, and will remain active in the room until it deals a set amount of damage. It can pass over Pits, but can not travel through Rocks or Poop.",
      "Notes": "While Isaac holds the candle above his head, his movement Speed is reduced.\nFlames remain active until depleted by dealing damage to enemies or upon changing rooms.\nThere is no limit to the number of fires that can be active. This is useful in situations where mob spawning can be controlled: for example, beating Boss Rush or Greed Mode as The Lost. This is time-consuming, but can be viable if your other sources of damage are weak or unreliable.\n  Boss behaviour in Boss Rush is not as predictable as in the original game, so more fires must be placed around the room.\nIt will block Isaac's tears but won't burn him.\nFlames do not drop any collectibles when doused.\nFlames will destroy shopkeepers.\nWhen using The Ludovico Technique, when the fire hits the tear, the tear resets and appears again on the player.\nThe player's tears can also shrink the size of the flame.\nThe 9 Volt decreases the recharge time of the item.\nThe flames from this item can put out Fireplaces.",
      "Trivia": "The Legend of Zelda, a major inspiration for The Binding of Isaac, also has a red candle item that can be activated to create flames for burning enemies and bushes, as well as lighting dark rooms. Unlike in Isaac however, where the red candle is unlocked first, the blue candle is the inferior version of the red one, which can be activated only once per room.\nThe Candle is a variation of this item unlocked after donating 900 coins, diminishing over time as opposed to contact.\nThe pickup quote of this item is a reference to the catchphrase of the Human Torch, a member of the Marvel Comics Fantastic Four"

Blended Hearts do not count.\nIf used in a Black Heart or Eternal Heart-containing Super Secret Room, it will spawn those types of hearts instead.\nIf a whole red heart is picked up and Isaac only heals half a heart container, the other half is placed in the jar indicated by the jar number increasing by one. Despite the jar indicating that it picked up a whole red heart in this fashion, it will only drop half a red heart on use. When picking up a double red heart, the jar will also store the remainder not healed in the same way.\nCo-op babies, with the exception of Magnet Baby, cannot add hearts to the jar as they are unable to interact with pickups.\n The Jar will retain its hearts inside the Schoolbag, but the player cannot pick up more hearts while it is inside the Schoolbag.",

Undefined by itself had no effect, but if it was ever picked up, should the game attempt to spawn an item from an exhausted item pool, the game would instead crash, as it could no longer spawn Undefined. From Rebirth onwards, an exhausted item pool will instead spawn Breakfast, even if the item would normally never spawn from that item pool and/or Breakfast had already been obtained in the run.\nIn programming \"Undefined\" refers to an unknown value.\nGiven the Glitch theme of the item and the ability to access Chapters that have not yet been unlocked using I AM ERROR, along with the ability to acquire mass upgrades in The Chest and The Dark Room, it is possible that it was intentionally made into a powerful sequence-breaking item.\nThe sprite for Undefined appears to be, fittingly, a glitched and spliced version of other item sprites, noticeably the bottom right part being the Compass, the bottom left being the Blood Bag, and the top half being Contract From Below.

      "Notes": "All enemies that aren't invincible and/or designated as a boss or mini-boss are able to be captured by the friendly ball. This includes enemies summoned from bosses such as Brownie's spawned Dips or The Cage's unique Vises.\n  It is generally wasteful to use this item on Mulligans and their variants as they will immediately rush towards enemies and try to kill themselves, leaving behind friendly debris. \n  If the captured enemy is a Globin variant (besides Black Globins for their lack of regenerative abilities) or a Dark Red Champion , the enemy will regenerate after dying, granting a much longer lifespan. \n  Wall Creeps and their variants stick to walls, backing far away from any potential danger they might encounter. \n  Stationary enemies that move underground (such as Round Worms or Lumps ) work surprisingly well as an ally as they shoot foes from far away and rarely ever get hurt. \n  Mom's Hand and Mom's Dead Hand will both one-shot almost all normal enemies and greatly damage most bosses with an incredibly small window for the hands to be hit, making them ideal for capturing. \n  Brimstone-capable enemies are very potent as their lasers can cause an obscene amount of damage to both enemies and most bosses. \n  If the captured enemy is one that spawns enemies, those enemies will be friendly as well. \n  If the ally is immune to damage (such as a Walking Host while its head is lowered), it will not take contact damage. \n  If the captured enemy is a Solid White Champion , it will be completely invincible, as it cannot be killed until the room counts as being cleared, at which point it can be killed by spikes or a Wall Hugger . \n  If an enemy that leaves behind a trail of damaging creep is caught, the creep created by the friendly mob will still damage Isaac when he walks over it.\n   This was changed in Afterbirth+. All creep created by a friendly enemy will only hurt grounded enemies and not the player. \n  The ball will only capture one segment of a Grub , one Buttlicker , or one Swarm Fly . However, when releasing a Swarm Fly, a new swarm is generated for it. \n  If a Heart is caught and then released, a Mask can use the friendly heart to live even if its original heart is destroyed. The room will not be cleared unless the Mask is killed.\n   The mask will ignore the friendly heart yet can still damage it. Bait the mask to charge towards the heart to destroy both. \n  If an Ipecac-capable enemy is caught, the explosive Ipecac shots it fires will not hurt Isaac.\n   This explosion immunity also applies to enemies that explode on death, and even the Troll Bombs left behind by Mulligoons . \n  The head of Rag Man can be captured by the ball while detached. It will not become a Ragling after being released, and only chases enemies by rolling.",
      "Interactions": "Car Battery: No effect.\nHive Mind: No effect on captured flies or spiders.\nSkatole orBursting Sack: Friendly Fly/Spider enemies will be unable able to shoot, slowed down, and/or reverted to a weaker form, hindering this item's effectiveness on those enemies.",

If the Glass is absorbed in a shop, Isaac is sent back to the previous room, but the Glass will be unused in the shop on its pedestal.

Changing from The Lost to any other character will leave them with half a soul heart. \n  When changing from The Lost, additional lives may be lost in the process, such as losing lives from Dead Cat.\nChanging to ??? will remove any red heart containers. If this would leave him with no soul/black hearts, he will have half a soul heart left.\nTransforming into a new character does not grant Isaac the starting items of the new character. For example, transforming into The Lost does not grant the D4 or Holy Mantle.\nIt is also possible for the Clicker to choose the same character as the one that is already being played as, making it seem like the item had no effect at all.\nSimilarly to items such as Judas' Shadow and Lazarus' Rags, any Completion Marks obtained will correspond with the character the Clicker turns you into.\nSince the Clicker removes the last item collected, it is wise to use it after picking up an unwanted item.\nRemoved items still count towards transformations.\nIf Isaac changes into Eden, a token will be used."

This means that finding it on a floor will not change the Treasure Room on that floor, nor will dropping it remove its effect on that floor's Treasure Room if Pay to Win was held when the floor was entered.\nThis trinket does not affect the two Treasure Rooms spawned in the Blue Womb.\nIn Greed Mode, this affects both normal and silver types of Treasure Rooms.",

      "Notes": "This trinket can be dangerous to hold, as the locust will instantly target the nearest enemy as Isaac enters the room, which can be close enough to catch Isaac in its blast radius.\nThe explosion takes most bomb effects from items that Isaac has, with some exceptions.\n  The Locust does not gain additional explosion damage or radius from Mr. Mega . \n  The explosion damage is halved to 30 by Bomber Boy without additional explosions. \n  Mini bombs from Scatter Bombs are not spawned. \n  Pickups will not spawn with Glitter Bombs .\nThe Locust will also spawn each time a wave in Boss Rush starts.",

They retain charge when picked up.\nFamiliar spawning actives: Active items that spawn blue flies, blue spiders, or items like Monster Manual will spawn those familiars before dropping.\n  This applies to active items that spawn pickups .\nGlowing Hour Glass: Is removed from Isaac and dropped, but is given back to Isaac discharged upon going back in time into the previous room. The room which Glowing Hour Glass was used in will not contain another Glowing Hour Glass.\nHow to Jump: Isaac animates a jump but his movement remains normal and he cannot go over any obstacles.\nMetronome: Effect from the Metronome is immediately cancelled beyond the gain of hearts, coins, bombs, or keys. Visual effect may persist until leaving the room.\nRazor Blade: Deals damage to Isaac as normal but does not increase damage for the current room.",

      "Notes": "This allows Isaac to leave boss rooms if the fight goes poorly.\n  This becomes particularly useful in The Void , where Isaac can enter a boss room and freely exit. This is useful if the player wants to just reach Delirium , and conversely, can also be used to escape from the Delirium fight if the player needs more time/items to prepare.\nIf a Devil Room has a Krampus fight in it, Isaac may choose not to fight him and leave.\nIf an Angel fight is started in an Angel Room the door will close and prevent leaving despite the Door Stop.\nIf Greed spawns in a Secret Room or Shop, Door Stop can be used to leave and come back to fight Greed again to potentially get multiple Steam Sales.\nHas no effect on Mom's boss room.\nCan be used to reset Holy Mantle shield. Very useful playing as The Lost.\nIf a Locust trinket is equipped as well, can be used to spawn an unlimited amount of locusts by repeatedly entering and exiting a room with enemies in it.\nIf a room contained champion enemies, upon leaving and re-entering the room, all previous champion enemies will have turned to regular enemies.",
